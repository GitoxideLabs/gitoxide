## 0.2.0 (2026-09-25)

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-383779c7f3c64c862a1101c6e196aa462160635f/> migrate errors to gix-error
 - <csr-id-4b42e0ce80ae934cae4f102f44c392581758608f/> raise MSRV to Rust 1.88
   <!-- agent -->
   The newly published `dua-core` 3.3 release used by linked-worktree removal
   requires Rust 1.88, so raise every workspace crate and the advertised badge
   together.
   
   Keep the MSRV checks buildable by selecting the latest `sysinfo` and `rusqlite`
   release lines that support Rust 1.88.

## 0.1.0 (2026-07-23)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-519e2d88a91d33b1576eabc5df0c2eccd7722fa0/> add `gix-zlib` crate
   This merely moves the `zlib` module into its own crate.
   Previously, there were multiple backends, but these times
   are over for a while and there is only one implementation: zlib-rs.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-6936e855adbce26c3acdc2ac2c3a6c6eef4e643e/> make zlib compression levels configurable
   Introduce a validated Compression type and require callers to choose a level when creating deflate streams. Optional serde support allows options in dependent crates to retain their serialization APIs.
