## Unreleased

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-3d789e07145af41fef1167b6765e78cbc796f029/> keep sanitized reference names nonempty and be more Git conformant
   <!-- agent -->
   Replace leading dots before stripping repeated `.lock` suffixes, matching Git so
   `.lock.lock` becomes `-lock` instead of losing its name. Handle empty sanitized
   output without indexing it.
   
   Keep `name_partial_or_sanitize()` returning `BString` and guarantee a nonempty
   valid partial reference name. Empty or slash-only input falls back to `-`;
   document this Gitoxide-specific behavior so callers need no empty-result
   handling.

## 0.12.0 (2026-09-25)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-348af0bfe67b94ee1de1c41162af955f1778c1c3/> preserve validation classifications after error conversion
   <!-- agent -->
   Expose the shared `ValidationError` marker from reference, tag, submodule,
   and path-component errors without changing their variants or input details.
   This lets callers distinguish invalid names from absent references through
   `gix::Error`, including optional reference lookups.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-4b42e0ce80ae934cae4f102f44c392581758608f/> raise MSRV to Rust 1.88
   <!-- agent -->
   The newly published `dua-core` 3.3 release used by linked-worktree removal
   requires Rust 1.88, so raise every workspace crate and the advertised badge
   together.
   
   Keep the MSRV checks buildable by selecting the latest `sysinfo` and `rusqlite`
   release lines that support Rust 1.88.

## 0.11.4 (2026-08-22)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-679f624e1b64a53ac09e880edd18348ecd162150/> reject a lone '@' as a reference name, like Git does
   `@` is shorthand for `HEAD` in revision syntax, so Git refuses a reference
   name consisting solely of it - see `check_or_sanitize_refname()` in `refs.c`,
   which `check_refname_format()` delegates to. It substitutes `-` when
   sanitizing, which is done here too.
   
   The visible effect was in refspec destinations: `git push origin "HEAD:@"`
   fails with `fatal: invalid refspec`, while `gix_refspec::parse("HEAD:@", Push)`
   returned `Ok(dst = "@")`. Sources were already correct, as `parse()` rewrites a
   bare `@` source to `HEAD`, but destinations reach `reference::name_partial()`.
   
   `@` remains valid as a component, so `refs/heads/@` and a tag named `@` are
   unaffected.
   
   Pins that `@` is rejected by `name()` and `name_partial()` while staying valid
   inside a path (`refs/heads/@`, `@/x`, `@@`), and that inputs collapsing to a
   lone `@` during sanitization are replaced too. The tag expectation changes
   because `mktests!` sanitizes as a reference name - a tag named `@` is still
   valid, as `refs/tags/@` is a legal ref.

## 0.9.0 (2024-08-22)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-62f586c4f8629bc6bad0ac0b18ec9b5f7a9a949e/> disallow `.lock` extensions per component.
   Previously, it would allow `foo.lock/bar`, and now it doesn't.
 - <csr-id-91d29c36ee4641ff2f9fc6452900dad26ee8ffb2/> prohibit full names with a trailing `.`.
   Just like in Git, it's considered invalid.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-13c79225ef41cfe21894eaecd32604c574b651d0/> `validate::tag::name()` now rejects names starting with slashes, and with empty components, too
   It's a breaking change as it renames the `DoubleDot` variant of `tag::Error` to `RepatedDot`, while moving
   a couple of variants from `reference::Error` to `tag::Error`

## 0.8.5 (2024-05-22)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-f1f0ba51cf1633bc2ca7e90904c01b8f8fee810e/> add `path::component_is_windows_device()`
   That way it's easy to determine if a component contains a windows device name
 - <csr-id-a67d82dce4346c6e76684b4405f33bec47d5bccd/> defend against `CON` device names and more if `gitoxide.core.protectWindows` is enabled.
   Note that trailing `.` are forbidden for some reason, but trailing ` ` (space) is forbidden
   as it's just ignored when creating directories or files, allowing them to be clobbered
   and merged silently.
 - <csr-id-eff4c00fc76b7bc8c8ac6a6ec4c5bd34889cc436/> add validation for path components
   That way it's easier to assure that forbidden names are never used
   as part of path components.

## 0.7.3 (2023-02-20)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-135d317065aae87af302beb6c26bb6ca8e30b6aa/> compatibility with `bstr` v1.3, use `*.as_bytes()` instead of `.as_ref()`.
   `as_ref()` relies on a known target type which isn't always present. However, once
   there is only one implementation, that's no problem, but when that changes compilation
   fails due to ambiguity.

## 0.7.2 (2023-02-17)

<csr-id-4d6ce803da12298b5780af920479679a39d923a0/>
<csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/>
<csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/>

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `git-features` and `git-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-99905bacace8aed42b16d43f0f04cae996cb971c/> upgrade `bstr` to `1.0.1`

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-39ed9eda62b7718d5109135e5ad406fb1fe2978c/> fix typos

</details>

## 0.7.1 (2022-12-19)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.7.0 (2022-11-21)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `gix-features` and `gix-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

## 0.6.0 (2022-09-20)

<csr-id-4d6ce803da12298b5780af920479679a39d923a0/>

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-99905bacace8aed42b16d43f0f04cae996cb971c/> upgrade `bstr` to `1.0.1`

### Chore (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-4d6ce803da12298b5780af920479679a39d923a0/> replace `quick-error` with `thiserror`

## 0.5.5 (2022-08-24)

<csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/>
<csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes
 - <csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/> remove default link to cargo doc everywhere
