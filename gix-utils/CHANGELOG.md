### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-fbcb26286297b76f90a39c703a40259bd72e261b/> avoid redundant Unicode precomposition work
   <!-- agent -->
   We now preserve macOS conversion failures per filename, but splitting
   every path adds work even for ASCII. In the initial benchmark, ASCII paths
   took about 2.6-2.8 times as long as before. The existing `is_nfc()`
   check can also perform a full NFC conversion before our compatibility
   composer performs its own decomposition and composition.
   
   Use `is_nfc_quick()` and detect non-BMP characters through the same iterator.
   Only scan its unvisited suffix if quick-check stops early. ASCII strings
   return immediately; ASCII paths also avoid UTF-8 validation and splitting.
   Process BMP-only paths together, reserving component splitting for paths
   with conversion failures. Specialize filename and path handling at compile
   time to keep the path fallback out of the filename loop.
   
   Skip combining-class and composition lookups for ASCII starters, use byte
   lengths for buffer capacities instead of counting characters, and reserve
   the output string before encoding it. Keep noncanonical mark order, Hangul
   composition, component-local fallback, and the original `Cow` when unchanged.
   
   The capacity estimate can reserve more space than the previous character
   count. Inconclusive NFC checks can now use a temporary buffer even if the
   result is unchanged; the benchmark explicitly covers that case. There are
   no new runtime dependencies; Criterion is already used in this workspace.
   
   Add a Criterion benchmark covering filenames and paths with ASCII, NFC,
   NFD, Hangul, noncanonical marks, and mixed emoji/decomposed components.

   The NFC string with an uncomposable mark costs about 0.9 ns more; the
   other measured cases improved. These are normalization microbenchmarks,
   not measurements of complete status operations.

 - <csr-id-4f7454a4a1a11a2555215eb414c048df9a6cab9f/> preserve filenames rejected by macOS precomposition
   <!-- agent -->
   The original Starship report states that a tracked filename
   containing both an emoji and a decomposed umlaut is reported
   as untracked by `gix status`.
   
   Git's macOS `UTF-8-MAC` conversion rejects characters outside the Basic
   Multilingual Plane. When conversion fails, Git keeps the entire original
   input, including any decomposed umlauts before or after the rejected
   character. Our precomposition instead changed those umlauts, preventing
   the directory walk from matching Git's index entries.
   
   Preserve inputs containing non-BMP characters in the shared precomposition
   helper. Apply that rule separately to each filesystem-path component,
   preserving path separators and borrowing unchanged paths. Reference packing
   and lookup also use component-wise precomposition, consistent with loose
   reference iteration.
   
   Explicit file roots in the directory walk use the same path helper, so
   their emitted spelling agrees with ordinary traversal beneath emoji
   directories. Extend the existing root-precomposition test to cover an
   emoji parent and an emoji filename, with precomposition enabled and disabled.
   
   An emoji outside a reference name must not suppress that name's
   precomposition: otherwise loose and packed versions of an umlaut branch
   can be emitted twice. Cover that review finding, packing and lookup below
   an emoji component, both emoji/umlaut orderings, another supplementary-plane
   character, the reported `Teaching/🎥 Überwachung im digitalen Zeitalter.md`
   filename, and BMP-only controls.
   
   Restore the requested reference spelling after lookup instead of
   decomposing the entire returned name. Whole-name decomposition could alter
   an untouched emoji/umlaut component and make the returned name unusable
   for another lookup or deletion. Cover mixed composition, loose and packed
   references, full names, and worktree-qualified lookup round trips.
   Keep canonical pseudo-ref names when precomposition changes their
   classification, including worktree-qualified pseudo-refs.
   
   Both the helper regression and macOS status regression failed before the
   fix and now pass, as do the reference regressions added for the review
   finding. Validated the `gix-utils`, `gix-fs`, `gix-dir`, `gix-status`, and
   `gix-ref` suites, the `gix` status tests with default features and with
   `--no-default-features --features basic,extras,comfort`, targeted Clippy
   with warnings denied, and `cargo fmt --all -- --check`.
   
   Git reference: Apple Git 2.54.0 with `core.precomposeUnicode=true` leaves
   the repository clean. `/usr/bin/iconv -f UTF-8-MAC -t UTF-8` rejects these
   non-BMP characters. `compat/precompose_utf8.c::precompose_utf8_readdir()`
   and `precompose_string_if_needed()` at
   `d38352cd43ab9745686d697872408bc3249a153f` retain the original input on
   conversion failure.

## 0.4.0 (2026-09-25)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-fde4d7d81536d9014aa0b8e1dd65eb521341b6e3/> add `git_is_space()`
   It's very niche but needed for correctness in globs and git-config parsing.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-4b42e0ce80ae934cae4f102f44c392581758608f/> raise MSRV to Rust 1.88
   <!-- agent -->
   The newly published `dua-core` 3.3 release used by linked-worktree removal
   requires Rust 1.88, so raise every workspace crate and the advertised badge
   together.
   
   Keep the MSRV checks buildable by selecting the latest `sysinfo` and `rusqlite`
   release lines that support Rust 1.88.

## 0.3.6 (2026-08-22)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-234181b199b533594ec9e41f3623e399d414e9e1/> preserve combining-mark order when precomposing paths
   <!-- agent -->
   On macOS, gix status reported a tracked dua-cli fixture as untracked while git
   status was clean. The filename contains valid combining marks in noncanonical
   order; full NFC normalization reordered them before the directory walk looked
   the path up in the index.
   
   Recompose filesystem-decomposed characters without canonical reordering,
   preserving non-composable combining-mark byte order. Cover both the helper behavior
   and a Git-created index entry in the directory walk.
   
   Git baseline: Git 2.50.1 uses UTF-8-MAC to UTF-8 iconv conversion
   in compat/precompose_utf8.c, with directory-read coverage in
   t/t3910-mac-os-precompose.sh. That conversion leaves the reported combining-mark
   order unchanged.

## 0.3.4 (2026-07-15)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-96ead72d7d15ca6345ef2b1f30842946c9f68fa8/> add `rng` module to `gix-utils` for better inter-process seeding
   This should avoid flaky capability tests of multiple process acting on the
   same repository.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-efa5ffcf9a2acdcaf7877ef350f24cf120854334/> seed fast pseudo-random numbers to differ across processes
   `gix-utils` and `gix-fs` drew fast pseudo-random numbers from `fastrand`'s
   global generators, whose per-thread seed is derived only from values that
   can coincide between separate processes (notably small thread IDs). Two
   concurrently running processes could therefore produce identical sequences,
   which weakens backoff jitter (meant to avoid a thundering herd of retries)
   and can make the filesystem capability probes collide on their temporary
   file names -- e.g. spuriously reporting that symlinks are unsupported (#1789).
   
   Add a `gix_utils::rng` module that draws from a per-thread `fastrand::Rng`
   seeded from a high-entropy OS source via `getrandom`, and route the affected
   call sites (backoff jitter and the `gix-fs` capability probes) through it.
   
   `getrandom` is a target-specific dependency that is excluded on
   `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, which has no entropy backend by default and runs a
   single process; there a best-effort seed is used that deliberately avoids
   `Instant::now()` (which panics on that target).

## 0.2.0 (2025-04-04)

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-d737c4a6856c01a54c3ec1eea9ee4b70d76f67ab/> Rename `Exponential` backoff to `Quadratic`
   The `gix_utils::backoff::Exponential` type actually implemented
   quadratic, not exponential, backoff. This renames it from
   `Exponential` to `Quadratic`.
   
   In exponential backoff, delays are a fixed base, often 2, raised to
   a power of a number that increases by one with each attempt. When
   the number that increases by one with each attempt is the base,
   raised to a fixed power, that is quadratic backoff.
   
   The intended behavior here was quadratic, as implemented. For
   example, in the tests, `EXPECTED_TILL_SECOND` lists the values 1,
   4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, and so on, which are ascending
   squares. If they were an exponential sequence, then they would look
   like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, and so on.
   
   Thus, it is only the named that needed to be changed: the
   implementation was already as intended.

## 0.1.0 (2023-04-19)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-b83ee366a3c65c717beb587ad809268f1c54b8ad/> Rename `serde1` cargo feature to `serde` and use the weak-deps cargo capability.
   With it it's possible to not automatically declare all optional dependencies externally visible
   features, and thus re-use feature names that oterwise are also a crate name.
   
   Previously I thought that `serde1` is for future-proofing and supporting multiple serde versions
   at the same time. However, it's most definitely a burden I wouldn't want anyway, so using
   `serde` seems to be the way to go into the future.
