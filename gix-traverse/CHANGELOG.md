## 0.44.0 (2025-01-18)

<csr-id-17835bccb066bbc47cc137e8ec5d9fe7d5665af0/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-17835bccb066bbc47cc137e8ec5d9fe7d5665af0/> bump `rust-version` to 1.70
   That way clippy will allow to use the fantastic `Option::is_some_and()`
   and friends.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-22f8939d862c74f2f55c74fded2f066a6d6536a1/> `tree::depthfirst()` traversal
   A depth-first traversal yields the `.git/index` order.
   
   It's a breaking change as the `Visitor` trait gets another way
   to pop a tracked path, suitable for the stack used for depth first.

## 0.43.1 (2024-12-22)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-59148a2043f0f502edfb895e19843b7fab6efeac/> add `topo::Builder::new` fn for creating a bare builder
   Previously, the only way to create a `Builder` would be via
   `Builder::from_iters`. That fn takes as arguments both the tips and
   ends, and used to be the only possibility for specifying either of them
   during the building process. However, in order to enhance the builder-
   likeness of `Builder`, we recently introduced fns `with_tips` and
   `with_ends` for adding additional tips and ends.
   
   With those fns, the only component which needs to be supplied up-front
   is `find`. Users can specify and empty `Iterator` and `None` for `tips`
   and `ends` respectively when calling `Builder::from_iters` and add
   additional tips and ends at their leisure, without the need to chain
   `Iterator`s or collecting them in some external data structure.
   
   Now, calling `Builder::from_iters` with a empty lists for tips and ends
   is a bit awkward. Thus, we provide a new method for creating a bare
   `Builder`.
 - <csr-id-a7a8d7cd79550033cc9e0277a0ab9155e5ab6739/> add `topo::Builder::with_tips` fn for adding tips after from_iters
   Currently, `Builder::from_iters` takes as arguments both the tips and
   ends. Previously, this would be the only possibility for specifying
   either of them during the building process. To enhance the
   builder-likeness of `Builder`, we recently introduced a fn for adding
   additional ends.
   
   This change introduces a fn which allows adding additional tips after
   initial construction of a "fresh" `Builder`, allowing for more usage
   patterns.
 - <csr-id-1c1d03775ce169dc3a353c2b81ce5770cbda15f5/> add `topo::Builder::with_ends` for adding ends after from_iters
   Currently, `Builder::from_iters` takes as arguments both the tips and
   ends, and it's the only possibility for specifying either of them during
   the building process. Considering that `ends` in `Builder::from_iters`
   is an `Option`, this is not very builder-like and obstructs some
   use-cases.
   
   This change introduces a fn which allows adding additional ends after
   initial construction of a "fresh" `Builder`.

## 0.42.0 (2024-10-22)

<csr-id-64ff0a77062d35add1a2dd422bb61075647d1a36/>

### Other

 - <csr-id-64ff0a77062d35add1a2dd422bb61075647d1a36/> Update gitoxide repository URLs
   This updates `Byron/gitoxide` URLs to `GitoxideLabs/gitoxide` in:
   
   - Markdown documentation, except changelogs and other such files
     where such changes should not be made.
   
   - Documentation comments (in .rs files).
   
   - Manifest (.toml) files, for the value of the `repository` key.
   
   - The comments appearing at the top of a sample hook that contains
     a repository URL as an example.
   
   When making these changes, I also allowed my editor to remove
   trailing whitespace in any lines in files already being edited
   (since, in this case, there was no disadvantage to allowing this).
   
   The gitoxide repository URL changed when the repository was moved
   into the recently created GitHub organization `GitoxideLabs`, as
   detailed in #1406. Please note that, although I believe updating
   the URLs to their new canonical values is useful, this is not
   needed to fix any broken links, since `Byron/gitoxide` URLs
   redirect (and hopefully will always redirect) to the coresponding
   `GitoxideLabs/gitoxide` URLs.
   
   While this change should not break any URLs, some affected URLs
   were already broken. This updates them, but they are still broken.
   They will be fixed in a subsequent commit.
   
   This also does not update `Byron/gitoxide` URLs in test fixtures
   or test cases, nor in the `Makefile`. (It may make sense to change
   some of those too, but it is not really a documentation change.)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-1dbb94adeeea4ca09a7899697a3380c1e6a03130/> add option to traverse commits from oldest to newest
   This change introduces an enum to control commit traversal order.
   Users can now choose between newest-first or oldest-first traversal.
   The default behavior remains newest-first, but it can be toggled
   by passing a CommitTimeOrder to a Sorting::ByCommitTime* variant.
   
   This feature is particularly useful for searching early repository
   history. The implementation remains largely agnostic to this change,
   with only minor logic adjustments in key areas as necessary.
   
   The reversed order is achieved by inverting the PriorityQueue key
   when an oldest-first traversal is requested.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-5ef8ae83ef078612f86099b00e3441e16bd15068/> make topo-traversal resilient against broken parent-id queries.
   That way, commiit-graph related errors won't be propagated.

## 0.39.0 (2024-04-13)

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-2a9c178326b7f13ba6bc1f89fc2b9d9facbecf48/> Make `topo` more similar to `Ancestors`, but also rename `Ancestors` to `Simple`
 - <csr-id-3f938faf9e6323b8056ee286f299747e15e6a0d3/> adjust the structure of `commit::ancestors` to be more consistent with other plumbing crates.
   This makes sure that each time is reached by only a single path.
 - <csr-id-e0969c3cc928b31345c4f3a122466193697eb0fc/> simplify ancestor module..
   We remove ability to reuse `State` as ultimately,this capability
   wasn't all that useful.

## 0.36.1 (2023-12-30)

<csr-id-3bd09ef120945a9669321ea856db4079a5dab930/>

### Chore

- <csr-id-3bd09ef120945a9669321ea856db4079a5dab930/> change `rust-version` manifest field back to 1.65.
  They didn't actually need to be higher to work, and changing them
  unecessarily can break downstream CI.

  Let's keep this value as low as possible, and only increase it when
  more recent features are actually used.

## 0.27.0 (2023-06-10)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-6c5c66e10550923941b3d22e862f0f3f26d7ba03/> `commit::Ancestors::with_commit_graph(graph)` to set and use a commitgraph.
   That way, traversal speed is greatly improved for traversals that only need
   access to parents and commit time, while still being more efficient if it
   saves the caller to retrieve a commit again to parse it for parents.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-8d7b62736848841e0577aa0498eb39aec492a2fa/> `gix_traverse::commit::Ancestors` now returns rich commit information.
   As part of the iteration, it will decode part of the commit and read parents and possibly
   the commit time if time-based sorting is desired. These values will now be made available
   instead of just the `id` of the commit.
   
   This saves the caller time to parse the commit again in case it needs similar information.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-affc9df48e7b7540a95e2d6024f05b391f38c8f0/> previously the commit-traversal sorted by date must have been wonky & rename `Sorting::Topological` to `Sorting::BreadthFirst`.
   This is now fixed by using a proven data structure, the `BinaryHeap` as priority
   queue.
   
   The rename is to differentiate `git log --topo-order` from what we are doing, which is actually quite
   different.

## 0.22.2 (2023-02-20)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-9e391e916402aafa7a20c704d11e21a91bda63b5/> add `tree::Recorder::path_clone()` and `tree::Recorder::track_filename()` builder method.
   That way, the recorder can be used in other applications to keep track of the full
   path *or* the filename.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-e14dc7d475373d2c266e84ff8f1826c68a34ab92/> note that crates have been renamed from `git-*` to `gix-*`.
   This also means that the `git-*` prefixed crates of the `gitoxide` project
   are effectively unmaintained.
   Use the crates with the `gix-*` prefix instead.
   
   If you were using `git-repository`, then `gix` is its substitute.

## 0.22.1 (2023-02-17)

<csr-id-ebc7f47708a63c3df4415ba0e702660d976dfb3e/>

<csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/>

### Refactor (BREAKING)

- <csr-id-ebc7f47708a63c3df4415ba0e702660d976dfb3e/> remove pack-cache from `Find::try_find(…)`
  With the new architecture this can be an implementation detail without
  forcing it to be Sync.
- <csr-id-2290d006705ff47ad780b009fe58ee422b3285af/> move git_pack::data::Object to git_object::Data, massively alter git_odb::Find trait
  This will break a lot, but has to happen to prepare these traits for the
  next generation of object databases.

### Other (BREAKING)

- <csr-id-2f2d856efe733d3cf81110c0e0607d2e7c40d968/> Avoid duplicate module paths in 'tree' and 'commit'

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-dcdf6573a90c7f9a6855aa7be8bf707b92b73ecf/> commit traversal now sorts by commit-time more thoroughly
   Previously the sorting was only partial as it was only among parents.
   Now it is full and among all currently visible commits.
   
   That way it is similar to what `git log` would produce.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `git-features` and `git-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-83746f613a559a86a0ea81370fca3f094bc81e35/> require `Ancestors` traversal `find()` to return `Result`
   Previously it would return an `Option` and squelch legitimate errors
   which already let to quite a bug hunt.
   
   Now `find()` should always return the original error when finding an
   existing object, and keep it around in a Box.
   That way we don't add yet another type parameter.
   
   Performance implications are measurable, but marginable. The error type
   might be too big which is something we can indeed look at.
 - <csr-id-5cf9323dbe09789e806ed55d865281298af1a11b/> rename `commit::Ancestors::mode()` to `*::parents()`
   The previous name was too generic to be helpful or discoverable.

### Test

- <csr-id-1d5ab44145ccbc2064ee8cc7acebb62db82c45aa/> ensure tests use 'merge.ff false' and recreate fixtures on each run

### Other

- <csr-id-7bce49c1d27cb279b61ff51de0038e01fcf3561e/> commit traversal along the first parent…
  …which allows to traverse only the 'mainline' part of the commit
  ancestry, ignoring merges entirely.

  This kind of traversal is more suited to algorithms which want
  to see a linear history as well as segments of commits between
  references.
- <csr-id-cbc5b8171cdef5933d684c481300d9fcff43cf4b/> try git-cliff…
  …but to no avail as it simpy won't work for us if we don't follow
  conventional commits properly, especially the absence of breaking
  changes support is a real issue.

  It's probably better to just implement it ourselves in smart-release.
- <csr-id-329d183ad4e256a4f9cdeb34589b5f3432495f79/> object_id

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-153dad1450d1d0416601a07548e853253fe150f6/> Ordering of tips is now enforced if topo-order isn't chosen.
   Previously the starting tips might still have been unordered, despite
   their values being correct, which could have caused all kinds of issues
   down the road. The most important one was that traversal by date
   wouldn't work with more than one tip.
 - <csr-id-921f565087c8ad77b9035b46843a11c8cd8f12d3/> docs now highlight performance implications of commit traversal by commit time

### New Features

 - <csr-id-86a99a90eb992322099a870fbba10dddbcb80e83/> add `commit::Sorting::ByCommitTimeNewestFirstCutoffOlderThan(time)`.
   It allows to stop traversals early if all commmits to be traversed are
   older than a given time.
 - <csr-id-6b2af578fbff43999266c2af324070b013d1699f/> Make it possible to access the current commits buffer during commit ancestor iteration.
   This is useful to avoid additional lookups of the same object for
   reading additional data from it.
   
   Currently one needs an object cache to avoid duplciate object extraction
   work, with such a cache being slower than accessing the same buffer
   again.
 - <csr-id-eb36a3dda83a46ad59078a904f4e277f298a24e1/> Add sorting mode to ancestor traversal  #270

### Chore

- <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes
- <csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/> remove default link to cargo doc everywhere

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-39ed9eda62b7718d5109135e5ad406fb1fe2978c/> fix typos

## 0.22.0 (2023-01-06)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.21.0 (2022-12-30)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.20.0 (2022-12-19)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.19.0 (2022-11-21)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `gix-features` and `gix-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

## 0.18.0 (2022-10-10)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-86a99a90eb992322099a870fbba10dddbcb80e83/> add `commit::Sorting::ByCommitTimeNewestFirstCutoffOlderThan(time)`.
   It allows to stop traversals early if all commmits to be traversed are
   older than a given time.

## 0.17.0 (2022-09-20)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-6b2af578fbff43999266c2af324070b013d1699f/> Make it possible to access the current commits buffer during commit ancestor iteration.
   This is useful to avoid additional lookups of the same object for
   reading additional data from it.
   
   Currently one needs an object cache to avoid duplciate object extraction
   work, with such a cache being slower than accessing the same buffer
   again.

## 0.16.4 (2022-09-01)

Maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.16.3 (2022-08-28)

Maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.16.2 (2022-08-24)

<csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/>
<csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/>

### Chore

- <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes
- <csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/> remove default link to cargo doc everywhere

## 0.16.1 (2022-08-17)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-153dad1450d1d0416601a07548e853253fe150f6/> Ordering of tips is now enforced if topo-order isn't chosen.
   Previously the starting tips might still have been unordered, despite
   their values being correct, which could have caused all kinds of issues
   down the road. The most important one was that traversal by date
   wouldn't work with more than one tip.
 - <csr-id-921f565087c8ad77b9035b46843a11c8cd8f12d3/> docs now highlight performance implications of commit traversal by commit time

## 0.16.0 (2022-07-22)

This is a maintenance release with no functional changes.

## 0.15.0 (2022-05-18)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.14.0 (2022-04-05)

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-dcdf6573a90c7f9a6855aa7be8bf707b92b73ecf/> commit traversal now sorts by commit-time more thoroughly
   Previously the sorting was only partial as it was only among parents.
   Now it is full and among all currently visible commits.
   
   That way it is similar to what `git log` would produce.

## 0.13.0 (2022-04-03)

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-83746f613a559a86a0ea81370fca3f094bc81e35/> require `Ancestors` traversal `find()` to return `Result`
   Previously it would return an `Option` and squelch legitimate errors
   which already let to quite a bug hunt.
   
   Now `find()` should always return the original error when finding an
   existing object, and keep it around in a Box.
   That way we don't add yet another type parameter.
   
   Performance implications are measurable, but marginable. The error type
   might be too big which is something we can indeed look at.

## 0.12.0 (2022-01-23)

<csr-id-ebc7f47708a63c3df4415ba0e702660d976dfb3e/>
<csr-id-2290d006705ff47ad780b009fe58ee422b3285af/>
<csr-id-1d5ab44145ccbc2064ee8cc7acebb62db82c45aa/>

### Test

- <csr-id-1d5ab44145ccbc2064ee8cc7acebb62db82c45aa/> ensure tests use 'merge.ff false' and recreate fixtures on each run

### New Features

 - <csr-id-eb36a3dda83a46ad59078a904f4e277f298a24e1/> Add sorting mode to ancestor traversal  #270

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-5cf9323dbe09789e806ed55d865281298af1a11b/> rename `commit::Ancestors::mode()` to `*::parents()`
   The previous name was too generic to be helpful or discoverable.
- remove pack-cache from `Find::try_find(…)`
  With the new architecture this can be an implementation detail without
  forcing it to be Sync.
- move gix_pack::data::Object to gix_object::Data, massively alter gix_odb::Find trait
  This will break a lot, but has to happen to prepare these traits for the
  next generation of object databases.

## 0.11.0 (2021-11-29)

A maintenance release, triggered by putting too many adjustments into a single commit.

## 0.10.1 (2021-11-16)

A maintenance release triggered by changes to gix-pack and changelog rewrites.

## v0.10.0 (2021-10-19)

A maintenance release to properly dealing with previously breaking changes in `gix-hash`.

## v0.9.0 (2021-10-15)

<csr-id-2f2d856efe733d3cf81110c0e0607d2e7c40d968/>
<csr-id-cbc5b8171cdef5933d684c481300d9fcff43cf4b/>
<csr-id-329d183ad4e256a4f9cdeb34589b5f3432495f79/>
<csr-id-7bce49c1d27cb279b61ff51de0038e01fcf3561e/>

Some module paths have been removed to avoid path duplication, possibly leading to breakage.

### Other

- <csr-id-cbc5b8171cdef5933d684c481300d9fcff43cf4b/> try git-cliff…
  …but to no avail as it simpy won't work for us if we don't follow
  conventional commits properly, especially the absence of breaking
  changes support is a real issue.

  It's probably better to just implement it ourselves in smart-release.
- <csr-id-329d183ad4e256a4f9cdeb34589b5f3432495f79/> object_id
- <csr-id-7bce49c1d27cb279b61ff51de0038e01fcf3561e/> commit traversal along the first parent…
  …which allows to traverse only the 'mainline' part of the commit
  ancestry, ignoring merges entirely.

  This kind of traversal is more suited to algorithms which want
  to see a linear history as well as segments of commits between
  references.

### BREAKING

- Avoid duplicate module paths in `tree` and `commit`
